<h3 id="_unified_development_experience">Unified Development Experience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We constantly challenge ourselves on how we can make things more consistent and easier to understand, so our customers are not confronted with haphazard development choices. This is a long and self-evolving journey as consistency is relative and there will be things that are outside our control. We now humbly take another step in this direction to improve our developer experience by unifying project name, artifact ID and properties.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_simplified_dependency_management">Simplified Dependency Management</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dependency management is one of the core value pillars that has helped Spring establish preeminence over to other Java frameworks. In that spirit, we have also been exploring ways to make dependency management easier for Spring developers on Azure. In this release, we have codified best practices and expertise from Spring experts and condensed all of our dependency BOMs into one, <code>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</code>, which we believe will further bring down the learning curve and avoid ill-handling of dependencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_expanded_support_scope_of_azure_support_on_start_spring_io">Expanded Support Scope of Azure Support on start.spring.io</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Azure Support module in <a href="https://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</a> provides auto-configuration of many Azure services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this release we have expanded the scope of Azure Support to cover the additional 4 more services:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kafka</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Hubs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure Cache for Redis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Configuration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our journey does end here and over time we will bring even more Azure services into the fold.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_untethered_and_unrestrained">Untethered and Unrestrained</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One feedback that we consistently hear is our Spring modules are unnecessarily stacked on top of too many layers of dependencies, which has prevented broader adoption. As an example, all of our early Spring modules rely on Spring Boot, and many of our customers are running Spring MVC apps in Tomcat, leveraging nothing but Spring Data, as an example, to communicate with data services. We now realize the flaw in our original design, and have rearchitected our Spring module dependencies from the ground up, untethered from layers of excess and entanglement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_more_control_and_secure">More Control and Secure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the heart of every real-world application, is identity and secret management. Support for managed identity has become an Azure fundamental that are getting mandated as a security baseline at individual services. We believe aligning on those guidelines will also benefit Spring developers at large, and have added Managed Identity support for App Configuration, Event Hub, Service Bus, Cosmos, Key Vault, Storage Blob, and Storage Queue. This enables building credential-free applications, which is a pattern that has picked up tremendous momentum both at Microsoft and in the community. In addition to Managed Identity, you can use any authentication methods supported in the underlying Azure SDK from our Spring libraries. For instance, you use SAS token and token credential to authenticate with Service Bus and Event Hubs. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable#defaultazurecredential">Credential chain</a> is now enabled by default, allowing applications to obtain credentials from application properties, environment variables, managed identity, IDEs, etc. Lastly providing granular level access control at the resource level (i.e.: Service Bus queue), is often of paramount importance when it comes to meeting the needs of our enterprise customers. We’ve now unlocked these controls to our customers for better security governance and adherence to IT policies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_more_options_exposed_in_a_spring_idiomatic_way">More Options Exposed in a Spring Idiomatic Way</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring developers have long enjoyed the convenience of defining client options in application configuration files. We certainly do not want to take that privilege away and burden Spring developers with setting options via client objects. To that end, we’ve significantly improved autoconfiguration coverage of Azure SDK clients for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_more_production_ready">More Production Ready</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly all the above would be in vain if we do not have enough feature coverage to support our customers in production. Many things come to my mind to make an application production-ready, but observability often arrives at the top. We’ve added health indicators for App Configuration, Event Hubs, Cosmos, Key Vault, Storage Blob, Storage Queue, Storage File, as well as Spring Cloud Sleuth support for all HTTP-based Azure SDKs. As an example, you now can prob if storage blob is up or down via Spring Boot actuator endpoint, as well as track dependencies and latencies going from your application to Cosmos DB.</p>
