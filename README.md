# spring-cloud-azure

This project pulls together the efforts being worked on in conjunction with Microsoft
to integrate Spring applications with Azure Cloud Services.  It hosts the gh-pages branch
that provides the content for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-azure/.

This project will not host source code directly, but provides a convenient jumping off
point into the Microsoft repositories that provide code that support Spring applications:

- https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-spring-boot
  Starters/Autoconfiguration for active directory, document db, keyvault, media services, service bus, storage.

- https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-data-documentdb
  Spring Data DocumentDB support.
