=== JPA with Azure MySQL

This article demonstrates creating a sample application that uses link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] to store and retrieve information in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/[Azure Database for MySQL].

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[The Java Persistence API (JPA)] is the standard Java API for object-relational mapping.

==== Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, link:https://azure.microsoft.com/free/[get a free trial].
- link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart[Azure Cloud Shell] or link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure CLI]. We recommend Azure Cloud Shell so you'll be logged in automatically and have access to all the tools you'll need.
- A supported link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure[Java Development Kit], version 8 (included in Azure Cloud Shell).
- link:https://curl.haxx.se[cURL] or a similar HTTP utility to test functionality.

==== Sample application

In this article, we will code a sample application. If you want to go faster, this application is already coded and available at link:https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quickstart-spring-data-jpa-mysql[https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quickstart-spring-data-jpa-mysql].

==== Prepare the working environment

First, set up some environment variables by using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP=database-workshop
AZ_DATABASE_NAME=<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>
AZ_LOCATION=<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>
AZ_MYSQL_USERNAME=spring
AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD>
AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS=<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>
----

Replace the placeholders with the following values, which are used throughout this article:

- `<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>`: The name of your MySQL server. It should be unique across Azure.
- `<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>`: The Azure region you'll use. You can use `eastus` by default, but we recommend that you configure a region closer to where you live. You can have the full list of available regions by entering `az account list-locations`.
- `<YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD>`: The password of your MySQL database server. That password should have a minimum of eight characters. The characters should be from three of the following categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0-9), and non-alphanumeric characters (!, $, #, %, and so on).
- `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>`: The IP address of your local computer, from which you'll run your Spring Boot application. One convenient way to find it is to point your browser to link:http://whatismyip.akamai.com/[whatismyip.akamai.com].

Next, create a resource group:

[source,bash]
----
az group create \
    --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    | jq
----

NOTE: We use the `jq` utility, which is installed by default on link:https://shell.azure.com/[Azure Cloud Shell] to display JSON data and make it more readable. If you don't like that utility, you can safely remove the `| jq` part of all the commands we'll use.

==== Create an Azure Database for MySQL instance

The first thing we'll create is a managed MySQL server.

NOTE: You can read more detailed information about creating MySQL servers in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-portal[Create an Azure Database for MySQL server by using the Azure portal].

In link:https://shell.azure.com/[Azure Cloud Shell], run the following script:

[source,bash]
----
az mysql server create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    --sku-name B_Gen5_1 \
    --storage-size 5120 \
    --admin-user $AZ_MYSQL_USERNAME \
    --admin-password $AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD \
    | jq
----

This command creates a small MySQL server.

===== Configure a firewall rule for your MySQL server

Azure Database for MySQL instances are secured by default. They have a firewall that doesn't allow any incoming connection. To be able to use your database, you need to add a firewall rule that will allow the local IP address to access the database server.

Because you configured our local IP address at the beginning of this article, you can open the server's firewall by running:

[source,bash]
----
az mysql server firewall-rule create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME-database-allow-local-ip \
    --server $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --start-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --end-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    | jq
----

===== Configure a MySQL database

The MySQL server that you created earlier is empty. It doesn't have any database that you can use with the Spring Boot application. Create a new database called `demo`:

[source,bash]
----
az mysql db create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name demo \
    --server-name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    | jq
----


===== Generate the application by using Spring Initializr

Generate the application on the command line by entering:

[source,bash]
----
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,mysql -d baseDir=azure-database-workshop -d bootVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE -d javaVersion=8 | tar -xzvf -
----

===== Configure Spring Boot to use Azure Database for MySQL

Open the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file, and add the following. Be sure to replace the two `$AZ_DATABASE_NAME` variables and the `$AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD` variable with the values that you configured at the beginning of this article.

[source,properties]
----
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://$AZ_DATABASE_NAME.mysql.database.azure.com:3306/demo?serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=spring@$AZ_DATABASE_NAME
spring.datasource.password=$AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD

spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
----

WARNING: The configuration property `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` means that Spring Boot will automatically create a database schema at application start-up, and will try to delete it when it shuts down. This is great for testing, but this shouldn't be used in production!

NOTE: We append `?serverTimezone=UTC` to the configuration property `spring.datasource.url`, to tell the JDBC driver to use the UTC date format (or Coordinated Universal Time) when connecting to the database. Otherwise, our Java server would not use the same date format as the database, which would result in an error.

You should now be able to start your application by using the provided Maven wrapper:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Here's a screenshot of the application running for the first time:

==== Code the application

Next, add the Java code that will use JPA to store and retrieve data from your MySQL server.

Create a new `Todo` Java class, next to the `DemoApplication` class, and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Todo {

    public Todo() {
    }

    public Todo(String description, String details, boolean done) {
        this.description = description;
        this.details = details;
        this.done = done;
    }

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String description;

    private String details;

    private boolean done;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return details;
    }

    public void setDetails(String details) {
        this.details = details;
    }

    public boolean isDone() {
        return done;
    }

    public void setDone(boolean done) {
        this.done = done;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(o instanceof Todo)) {
            return false;
        }
        return id != null && id.equals(((Todo) o).id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return 31;
    }
}
----

This class is a domain model mapped on the `todo` table, that will be automatically created by JPA.

To manage that class, you'll need a repository. Define a new `TodoRepository` interface in the same package:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface TodoRepository extends JpaRepository<Todo, Long> {
}
----

This repository is a repository that Spring Data JPA manages.

Finish the application by creating a controller that can store and retrieve data. Implement a `TodoController` class in the same package, and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/")
public class TodoController {

    private final TodoRepository todoRepository;

    public TodoController(TodoRepository todoRepository) {
        this.todoRepository = todoRepository;
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public Todo createTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
        return todoRepository.save(todo);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public Iterable<Todo> getTodos() {
        return todoRepository.findAll();
    }
}
----

Finally, halt the application and start it again using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

==== Test the application

To test the application, you can use cURL.

First, create a new "todo" item in the database using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JPA correctly!","done": "true"}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

This command should return the created item as follows:

[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JPA correctly!","done":true}
----

Next, retrieve the data by using a new cURL request as follows:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

This command will return the list of "todo" items, including the item you've created, as follows:

[source,json]
----
[{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JPA correctly!","done":true}]
----

Here's a screenshot of these cURL requests:

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-data-jpa-with-azure-mysql/create-mysql-02.png[Test with cURL]

Congratulations! You've created a Spring Boot application that uses JPA to store and retrieve data from Azure Database for MySQL.

==== Clean up resources

To clean up all resources used during this quickstart, delete the resource group using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az group delete \
    --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --yes
----
