==== Azure Active Directory B2C

This article demonstrates creating a Java app with the link:https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] that uses the Spring Boot Starter for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

 * Create a Java application using the Spring Initializr
 * Configure Azure Active Directory B2C
 * Secure the application with Spring Boot classes and annotations
 * Build and test your Java application

link:https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory[Azure Active Directory] is Microsoft's cloud-scale enterprise identity solution. link:https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/[Azure Active Directory B2C] compliments the feature set of Azure Active Directory, allowing you to manage customer, consumer, and citizen access to your business-to-consumer (B2C) applications.

===== Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, create a link:https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F[free account] before you begin.
* A supported Java Development Kit (JDK). For more information about the JDKs available for use when developing on Azure, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure[Java support on Azure and Azure Stack].
* link:http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven], version 3.0 or later.

===== Create an app using Spring Initializr

* Step1. Browse to <https://start.spring.io/>.

* Step2. Fill out the values according to this guidance. Note that the labels and layout may differ from the image shown here.

** Under **Project**, select **Maven Project**.
** Under **Language**, select **Java**.
** Under **Spring Boot**, select **2.5.0**.
** Under **Group**, **Artifact** and **Name** enter the same value, using a short descriptive string. The UI may automatically fill some of these out as you type.
** In the **Dependencies** pane, select **Add Dependencies**. Use the UI to add dependencies on **Spring Web** and **Spring Security**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/fill-in-the-values-to-generate-the-project.png[Spring Initializr with values filled in.]

NOTE: Spring Security 5.5.1, 5.4.7, 5.3.10 and 5.2.11 have been released to address the following CVE report link:https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22119[CVE-2021-22119: Denial-of-Service attack with spring-security-oauth2-client]. If you're using the older version, please upgrade it.

* Step3. Select **Generate Project**, then download the project to a path on your local computer. Move the downloaded file to a directory named after your project and unzip the file. The file layout should look something like the following, with the value you entered for **Group** in place of `yourProject`.

===== Create and initialize an Azure Active Directory instance

====== Create the Active Directory instance

* Step1. Log into <https://portal.azure.com>.

* Step2. Select **Create a resource**. Search for **Azure Active Directory B2C**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/az-1-n.png[Create new Azure Active Directory B2C instance using the Azure portal.]

* Step3. Select **Create**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/az-5-n.png[Azure Marketplace entry for Azure Active Directory B2C.]

* Step4. Select **Create a new Azure AD B2C Tenant**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/az-2-n.png[Azure portal option to create new Azure AD B2C Tenant.]

* Step5. For **Organization name** and **Initial domain name**, provide appropriate values, then select **Create**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/az-3-n.png[Azure AD B2C Create Tenant screen.]

* Step6. When the Active Directory creation is complete, select your account in the upper right corner, then select **Switch directory**, then select the directory just created. You will be redirected to the new tenant home page. Then search for `b2c` and select **Azure AD B2C**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/az-4-n.png[Locate the Azure AD B2C service.]

====== Add an application registration for your Spring Boot app

* Step1. In the **Manage** pane on the left, select **App registrations**, and then select **New registration**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c1-n.png[Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure AD B2C App registrations screen.]

* Step2. In the **Name** field, enter your app's name, then select **Register**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c4-n.png[Azure AD B2C register an application form.]

* Step3. Back on the **Manage** pane, select **App registrations**, then select the application name you created.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c5-n.png[App registrations screen with display name selected.]

* Step4. Select **Authentication**, then **Add a platform** then **Web**. Set the **Redirect URIs** to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/`, then select **Configure**.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c7-n.png[Options selected for authentication, add a platform, web.]

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c8-n.png[Configure Web screen with Redirect URIs field selected.]

====== Add app secrets for your app

Select **Certificates & secrets**, then **New client secrets**. Input your secret description and then select **Add**. After you create the secret, select the copy icon next to the secret value to copy the value for use later in this article.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c9-n.png[Add a client secret screen.]

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/b2c10-n.png[Certificates and secrets screen with copy button selected.]

NOTE: If you leave the **Certificates & secrets** section and come back, you will not be able to see the secret value. In that case, you must create another secret and copy it for future use. Occasionally, the generated secret value may contain characters that are problematic for inclusion in the *application.yml* file, such as backslash or backtick. In that case, discard that secret and generate another one.

====== Add user flow

* Step1. Navigate to your tenant main page. In the **Policies** section of the left pane, select **User flows**, then select **New user flow**.

* Step2. You will now leave this tutorial, execute another tutorial, and come back to this tutorial when you're done. Here are some things to keep in mind when you go to the other tutorial.

* Start with the step that requests you to select **New User flow**.
* When this tutorial refers to `webapp1`, use the value you entered for **Group** instead.
* When you are selecting claims to return from the flows, ensure **Display Name** is selected. Without this claim, the app being built in this tutorial will not work.
* When you are asked to run the user flows, the redirect url you specified above is not yet active. You can still run the flows, but the redirection will not complete successfully. This is expected.
* When you reach "Next steps", return to this tutorial.

Follow all the steps in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows?pivots=b2c-user-flow[Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C] to create user flows for "sign-up and sign in", "profile editing" and "password reset".

Azure AD B2C supports local accounts as well as social identity providers. For an example of creating a GitHub identity provider, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/identity-provider-github?pivots=b2c-user-flow[Set up sign-up and sign-in with a GitHub account using Azure Active Directory B2C].

===== Configure and compile your app

Now that you've created the Azure AD B2C instance and some user flows, you'll connect your Spring app to the Azure AD B2C instance.

* Step1. From the command line, cd to the directory where you unzipped the .zip file you downloaded from Spring Initializr.

* Step2. Navigate to the parent folder for your project, and open the *pom.xml* Maven project file in a text editor.

* Step3. Add the dependencies for Spring OAuth2 security to the *pom.xml*:

[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
       <artifactId>azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory-b2c</artifactId>

       <artifactId>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</artifactId>
       <version>See Below</version>
   </dependency>
----

For the `azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory-b2c`, use the latest version available. You may be able to use link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure.spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory-b2c[mvnrepository.com] to look this up.

NOTE: We've released Spring Boot Starter for Azure Active Directory link:https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory/CHANGELOG.md[3.6.1] to address the following CVE report link:https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22119[CVE-2021-22119: Denial-of-Service attack with spring-security-oauth2-client]. If you're using the older version, please upgrade it to 3.6.1 or above.

For the `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`, use the version corresponding to the version of Spring Boot you selected above, for example `2.3.4.RELEASE`.

For `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5`, use the latest version available. You may be able to use link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.thymeleaf.extras/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5[mvnrepository.com] to look this up. As of this writing, the latest version is `3.0.4.RELEASE`.

* Step4. Save and close the *pom.xml* file.

** Verify that your dependencies are correct by running `mvn -DskipTests clean install`. If you do not see `BUILD SUCCESS`, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before continuing.

* Step5. Navigate to the *src/main/resources* folder in your project and create an *application.yml* file in a text editor.

* Step6. Specify the settings for your app registration using the values you created earlier; for example:

[source,yaml]
----
   azure:
     activedirectory:
       b2c:
         base-uri: https://<your-tenant-initial-domain-name>.b2clogin.com/<your-tenant-initial-domain-name>.onmicrosoft.com/
         client-id: <your-application-ID>
         client-secret: '<secret-value>'
         login-flow: sign-up-or-sign-in
         logout-success-url: <your-logout-success-URL>
         user-flows:
           sign-up-or-sign-in: <your-sign-up-or-sign-in-user-flow-name>
           profile-edit: <your-profile-edit-user-flow-name>
           password-reset: <your-password-reset-user-flow-name>
         user-name-attribute-name: <your-user-name-attribute-name>
----

Notice that the `client-secret` value is enclosed in single quotes. This is necessary because the value of `<secret-value>` will almost certainly contain some characters that require being inside single quotes when present in YAML.

[NOTE]
====
As of this writing, the full list of Active Directory B2C Spring Integration values that are available for use in *application.yml* is the following:
[source,yaml]
----
    azure:
      activedirectory:
        b2c:
          base-uri:
          client-id:
          client-secret:
          login-flow:
          logout-success-url:
          user-flows:
            sign-up-or-sign-in:
            profile-edit: # optional
            password-reset: # optional
          user-name-attribute-name:
----
The *application.yml* file is available in link:https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-spring-boot-samples/tree/main/aad/azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory-b2c/aad-b2c-web-application/src/main/resources/application.yml[Azure Active Directory B2C Spring Boot Sample] on GitHub.
====

* Step7. Save and close the *application.yml* file.

* Step8. Create a folder named *controller* in *src/main/java/\<yourGroupId\>/\<yourGroupId\>*, replacing `<yourGroupId>` with the value you entered for **Group**.

* Step9. Create a new Java file named *WebController.java* in the *controller* folder and open it in a text editor.

* Step10. Enter the following code, changing `yourGroupId` appropriately, then save and close the file:

[source,java]
----
   package yourGroupId.yourGroupId.controller;

   import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.authentication.OAuth2AuthenticationToken;
   import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.user.OAuth2User;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
   import org.springframework.ui.Model;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

   @Controller
   public class WebController {

       private void initializeModel(Model model, OAuth2AuthenticationToken token) {
           if (token != null) {
               final OAuth2User user = token.getPrincipal();

               model.addAttribute("grant_type", user.getAuthorities());
               model.addAllAttributes(user.getAttributes());
           }
       }

       @GetMapping(value = "/")
       public String index(Model model, OAuth2AuthenticationToken token) {
           initializeModel(model, token);

           return "home";
       }

       @GetMapping(value = "/greeting")
       public String greeting(Model model, OAuth2AuthenticationToken token) {
           initializeModel(model, token);

           return "greeting";
       }

       @GetMapping(value = "/home")
       public String home(Model model, OAuth2AuthenticationToken token) {
           initializeModel(model, token);

           return "home";
       }
   }
----

Because every method in the controller calls `initializeModel()`, and that method calls `model.addAllAttributes(user.getAttributes());`, any HTML page in *src/main/resources/templates* is able to access any of those attributes, such as `${name}`, `${grant_type}`, or `${auth_time}`. The values returned from `user.getAttributes()` are in fact the claims of the `id_token` for the authentication. The complete list of available claims is listed in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens#payload-claims[Microsoft identity platform ID tokens].

* Step11. Create a folder named *security* in *src/main/java/\<yourGroupId\>/\<yourGroupId\>*, replacing `yourGroupId` with the value you entered for **Group**.

* Step12. Create a new Java file named *WebSecurityConfiguration.java* in the *security* folder and open it in a text editor.

* Step13. Enter the following code, changing `yourGroupId` appropriately, then save and close the file:

[source,java]
----
   package yourGroupId.yourGroupId.security;

   import com.azure.spring.autoconfigure.b2c.AADB2COidcLoginConfigurer;
   import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
   import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
   import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

   @EnableWebSecurity
   public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

       private final AADB2COidcLoginConfigurer configurer;

       public WebSecurityConfiguration(AADB2COidcLoginConfigurer configurer) {
           this.configurer = configurer;
       }

       @Override
       protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
           http
                   .authorizeRequests()
                   .anyRequest()
                   .authenticated()
                   .and()
                   .apply(configurer)
           ;
       }
   }
----

* Step14. Copy the *home.html* file from link:https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-spring-boot-samples/tree/main/aad/azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory-b2c/aad-b2c-web-application/src/main/resources/templates[Azure AD B2C Spring Boot Sample] to *src/main/resources/templates*, and replace the `${your-profile-edit-user-flow}` and `${your-password-reset-user-flow}` with the names of the user flows that you created earlier.

===== Build and test your app

* Step1. Open a command prompt and change directory to the folder where your app's *pom.xml* file is located.

* Step2. Build your Spring Boot application with Maven and run it; for example:

NOTE: It's extremely important that the time according to the system clock under which the local spring boot app runs is accurate. There is very little tolerance of clock skew when using OAuth 2.0. Even three minutes of inaccuracy may cause the signin to fail with an error similar to `[invalid_id_token] An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: Jwt used before 2020-05-19T18:52:10Z`. As of this writing, link:https://time.gov/[time.gov] has an indicator of how far off your clock is from the actual time. The app was successfully run with a skew of +0.019 seconds.

[source,shell script]
----
   mvn -DskipTests clean package
   mvn -DskipTests spring-boot:run
----

* Step3. After your application is built and started by Maven, open `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser;
you should be redirected to login page.

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/lo1-n.png[Web app login page.]

* Step4. Select the link with text relating to signing in. You should be redirected Azure AD B2C to start the authentication process.

* Step5. After you have logged in successfully, you should see the sample `home page` from the browser,

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory-b2c-oidc/lo3-n.png[Web app successful login.]

===== Troubleshooting

The following sections describe how to resolve some problems you might encounter.

====== Missing attribute name in attributes

While running the sample, you might get an exception with the message `Missing attribute 'name' in attributes`. The log for this exception will look similar to the following output:

[source,shell script]
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Missing attribute 'name' in attributes
at org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.user.DefaultOAuth2User.<init>(DefaultOAuth2User.java:67) ~[spring-security-oauth2-core-5.3.6.RELEASE.jar:5.3.6.RELEASE]
at org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.DefaultOidcUser.<init>(DefaultOidcUser.java:89) ~[spring-security-oauth2-core-5.3.6.RELEASE.jar:5.3.6.RELEASE]

at org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.oidc.userinfo.OidcUserService.loadUser(OidcUserService.java:63) ~[spring-security-oauth2-client-5.3.6.RELEASE.jar:5.3.6.RELEASE]
----

If you get this error, double-check the user workflow you created in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows?pivots=b2c-user-flow[Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C]. When creating the user workflow, for **User attributes and claims**, be sure to choose attributes and claims for **Display Name**. Also, be sure to properly configure `user-name-attribute-name` in the *application.yml* file.

====== Sign in with loops to B2C endpoint

This issue is most likely due to polluted cookies for `localhost`. Clean up cookies for `localhost` and try it again.

===== Summary

In this tutorial, you created a new Java web application using the Azure Active Directory B2C starter, configured a new Azure AD B2C tenant, and registered a new application in it, and then configured your application to use the Spring annotations and classes to protect the web app.

===== Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use the link:https://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal] to delete the resources created in this article to avoid unexpected charges.
