=== Migrate an application to use passwordless connections with Azure Event Hubs for Kafka

This tutorial explains how to migrate from traditional authentication methods to more secure, passwordless connections.

Application requests to Azure Event Hubs for Kafka must be authenticated. Azure Event Hubs for Kafka provides different ways for apps to connect securely. One of them is to use the connection string. However, you should prioritize passwordless connections in your applications when possible.

The support for passwordless connections is enabled after Spring Cloud Azure 4.3.0. This article is a migration guide for removing credentials from Spring Cloud Stream Kafka applications.

==== Compare authentication options

When authenticating with Azure Event Hubs for Kafka, the application provides an authorized entity to connect the Event Hubs namespace. Apache Kafka protocols provide multiple Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms for authentication. According to the SASL mechanisms, there are two authentication options that you can use to authorize access to your secure resources: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication.

===== Azure AD Authentication

Microsoft Azure AD authentication is a mechanism for connecting to Azure Event Hubs for Kafka using identities defined in Azure AD. With Azure AD authentication, you can manage service principal identities and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management.

The benefits of using Azure AD include:

- Authentication of users across Azure services in a uniform way.
- Management of password policies and password rotation in a single place.
- Multiple forms of authentication supported by Azure AD, which can eliminate the need to store passwords.
- Customers can manage Event Hubs permissions using external (Azure AD) groups.
- Support for token-based authentication for applications connecting to Azure Event Hubs for Kafka.

===== SAS Authentication

Event Hubs also provides the Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for delegated access to Event Hubs for Kafka resources.

Although it's possible to connect to Azure Event Hubs for Kafka with SAS, they should be used with caution. Developers must be diligent to never expose the connection strings in an unsecure location. Anyone who gains access to the connection strings is able to authenticate. For example, if a connection string is accidentally checked into source control, sent through an unsecure email, pasted into the wrong chat, or viewed by someone who shouldn't have permission, there's risk of a malicious user accessing the application. Instead, authorizing access using the OAuth 2.0 token-based mechanism provides superior security and ease of use over SAS. Consider updating your application to use passwordless connections.

==== Introducing passwordless connections

With a passwordless connection, you can connect to Azure services without storing any credentials in the application, its configuration files, or in environment variables. Many Azure services support passwordless connections, such as Azure Managed Identity and Role Based Access Control (RBAC). These techniques provide robust security features that you can implement using `DefaultAzureCredential` from the Azure Identity client libraries. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to update an existing application to use `DefaultAzureCredential` instead of alternatives such as connection strings.

`DefaultAzureCredential` supports multiple authentication methods and automatically determines which should be used at runtime. This approach enables your app to use different authentication methods in different environments (local dev vs. production) without implementing environment-specific code.

The order and locations in which `DefaultAzureCredential` searches for credentials can be found in the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/Identity-readme[Azure Identity library overview]. For example, when working locally, `DefaultAzureCredential` will generally authenticate using the account the developer used to sign in to Visual Studio. When the app is deployed to Azure, `DefaultAzureCredential` will automatically switch to use a [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). No code changes are required for this transition.

NOTE: A managed identity provides a security identity to represent an app or service. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets. You can read more about managed identities in the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[overview] documentation.

To ensure that connections are passwordless, you must take into consideration both local development and the production environment. If a connection string is required in either place, then the application isn't passwordless.

In your local development environment, you can authenticate with Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Visual Studio, or Azure plugins for Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. In this case, you can use that credential in your application instead of configuring properties.

When you deploy applications to an Azure hosting environment, such as a virtual machine, you can enable managed identity in that environment. Then, you won't need to provide credentials to connect to Azure services.

==== Migrate an existing application to use passwordless connections

The following steps explain how to migrate an existing application to use passwordless connections instead of a SAS solution.

===== Prepare the working environment for local development authentication

First, use the following command to set up some environment variables.

[source,bash]
----
export AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP=<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>
export AZ_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME=<YOUR_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME>
export AZ_EVENTHUB_NAME=<YOUR_EVENTHUB_NAME>
----

Replace the placeholders with the following values, which are used throughout this article:

- `<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>`: The name of the resource group you'll use.
- `<YOUR_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME>`: The name of the Azure Event Hubs namespace you'll use.
- `<YOUR_EVENTHUB_NAME>`: The name of the event hub you'll use.

===== Grant permission for Azure Event Hubs

If you want to run this sample locally with Azure AD authentication, be sure your user account has authenticated via Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code Azure Account plugin, or Azure CLI. Also, be sure the account has been granted sufficient permissions.

*Azure portal*

1. In the Azure portal, locate your Event Hubs namespace using the main search bar or left navigation.

2. On the Event Hubs overview page, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu.

3. On the **Access control (IAM)** page, select the **Role assignments** tab.

4. Select **+ Add** from the top menu and then **Add role assignment** from the resulting drop-down menu.
+

5. Use the search box to filter the results to the desired role. For this example, search for *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* and select the matching result and then choose **Next**.

6. Under **Assign access to**, select **User, group, or service principal**, and then choose **+ Select members**.

7. In the dialog, search for your Azure AD username (usually your *user@domain* email address) and then choose **Select** at the bottom of the dialog.

8. Select **Review + assign** to go to the final page, and then **Review + assign** again to complete the process.

*Azure CLI*

To authenticate using the Azure CLI, use the following steps:

1. Use the following command to sign to your Azure account:
+
[source,bash]
----
   az login
----

2. Use the following command to set your current subscription context. Replace `ssssssss-ssss-ssss-ssss-ssssssssssss` with the GUID for the subscription you want to use with Azure:
+
[source,bash]
----
   az account set --subscription ssssssss-ssss-ssss-ssss-ssssssssssss
----

3. Use the following command to get the resource ID for your Azure Event Hubs namespace:
+
[source,bash]
----
   export AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID=$(az resource show \
       --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $AZ_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME \
       --resource-type Microsoft.EventHub/Namespaces \
       --query "id" \
       --output tsv)
----

4. Use the following command to get your user object ID of your Azure CLI user account:
+
[source,bash]
----
   export AZURE_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show \
       --query "id" --output tsv)
----

5. Use the following commands to assign *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* roles to your account.
+
[source,bash]
----
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee $AZURE_AD_ACCOUNT_ID \
       --role "Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver" \
       --scope $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee $AZURE_AD_ACCOUNT_ID \
       --role "Azure Event Hubs Data Sender" \
       --scope $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID
----

For more information about granting access roles, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory[Authorize access to Event Hubs resources using Azure Active Directory].

===== Sign-in and migrate the app code to use passwordless connections

For local development, make sure you're authenticated with the same Azure AD account you assigned the role to on your Event Hubs. You can authenticate via the Azure CLI, Visual Studio, Azure PowerShell, or other tools such as IntelliJ.

*Azure CLI*

Sign in to Azure through the Azure CLI by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az login
----

*Visual Studio*

Select the **Sign in** button in the top right corner of Visual Studio.

Sign in using the Azure AD account you assigned a role to previously.

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58474919/192251181-bb14b8a3-087e-4d43-82f7-53efe5c62e5b.png[visual-studio-sgin]

*Visual Studio Code*

Make sure you have the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account[Azure Account] extension installed.

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58474919/192251290-fb62fc4b-1031-45ce-90c9-bfb514da9b3a.png[Screenshot showing the Azure extension]

Use the **CTRL + Shift + P** shortcut to open the command palette. Search for the **Azure: Sign In** command and follow the prompts to authenticate. Make sure to use the Azure AD account you assigned a role to previously from your Blob Storage account.

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58474919/192251369-f1def1b4-331d-47ee-b142-9b852641025d.png[Screenshot showing the Azure sign-in command]

*PowerShell*

Sign in to Azure using PowerShell by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
Connect-AzAccount
----

Next, use the following steps to update your Spring Kafka application to use passwordless connections. Although conceptually similar, each framework uses different implementation details.

*Java*

1. Add the following configuration when you create your Kafka producer or consumer to support the link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_oauthbearer[SASL/OAUTHBEARER] mechanism. Replace the `<eventhubs-namesapce>` placeholder with the name of your Event Hubs namespace.
+
[source,java]
----
   Properties config = new Properties();
   config.put("bootstrap.servers", "<eventhubs-namesapce>.servicebus.windows.net:9093");
   config.put("security.protocol", "SASL_SSL");
   config.put("sasl.mechanism", "OAUTHBEARER");
   config.put("sasl.jaas.config", "org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required");
   config.put("sasl.login.callback.handler.class", "CustomAuthenticateCallbackHandler");
   new KafkaProducer<K, V>(config);
----

2. Implement a callback handler similar to link:https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/blob/master/tutorials/oauth/java/managedidentity/producer/src/main/java/CustomAuthenticateCallbackHandler.java[CustomAuthenticateCallbackHandler] in the link:https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka[azure-event-hubs-for-kafka] sample on GitHub.

*Spring Kafka*

1. Inside your project, add the following reference to the `com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-starter` package. This library contains all of the necessary entities to implement passwordless connections.
+
[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter</artifactId>
   </dependency>
----

2. Then, add the following property to configure the Kafka bootstrap server with your Azure Event Hubs namespace:

[source,properties]
----
   spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=$AZ_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME.servicebus.windows.net:9093
----

*Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Binder*

1. Inside your project, add the following reference to the `com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-starter` package. This library contains all of the necessary entities to implement passwordless connections.
+
[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter</artifactId>
   </dependency>
----

2. Then, add the following property to configure the Kafka bootstrap server with your Azure Event Hubs namespace:

[source,properties]
----
   spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers=$AZ_EVENTHUBS_NAMESPACE_NAME.servicebus.windows.net:9093
----

NOTE: If you're using version `4.3.0`, don't forget to set the `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<kafka-binder-name>.environment.spring.main.sources` property to `com.azure.spring.cloud.autoconfigure.kafka.AzureKafkaSpringCloudStreamConfiguration`. By default `<kafka-binder-name>` is `kafka` in a single kafka binder application. This property setting enables the whole OAuth authentication workflow. This setting is also used to specify the additional configuration `KafkaBinderConfigurationPropertiesBeanPostProcessor`, which specifies the OAuth security parameters for the particular binder to enable Azure Identity. For version after `4.4.0`, this property will be added automatically for each Kafka binder environment, so there's no need for you to add it manually.

====== Run the app locally

After making these code changes, run your application locally. The new configuration should pick up your local credentials, assuming you're logged into a compatible IDE or command line tool, such as the Azure CLI, Visual Studio, or IntelliJ. The roles you assigned to your local dev user in Azure will allow your app to connect to the Azure service locally.

===== Configure the Azure hosting environment

After your application is configured to use passwordless connections and runs locally, the same code can authenticate to Azure services after it's deployed to Azure. For example, an application deployed to an Azure Spring Apps instance that has a managed identity enabled can connect to Azure Event Hubs for Kafka.

In this section, you'll execute two steps to enable your application to run in an Azure hosting environment in a passwordless way:

- Create the managed identity for your Azure hosting environment.
- Assign roles to the managed identity.

NOTE: Azure also provides the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-connector/overview[Service Connector] service, which can help you connect your hosting service with Event Hubs.With Service Connector to configure your hosting environment, you can omit the step of assigning roles to your managed identity because Service Connector will do it for you.The following section describes how to configure your Azure hosting environment in two ways: one via Service Connector and the other by configuring each hosting environment directly.

[#create-the-managed-identity-for-your-azure-hosting-environment]
===== Create the managed identity for your Azure hosting environment

The following steps show you how to create a system-assigned managed identity for various web hosting services. The managed identity can securely connect to other Azure Services using the app configurations you set up previously.

*Service Connector*

When using Service Connector, it can help to create the system-assigned managed identity to your Azure hosting environment, and then configure the *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* roles for the managed identity.

The following compute services are currently supported:

   - Azure App Service
   - Azure Spring Cloud
   - Azure Container Apps (preview)

For this migration guide, you'll use App Service, but the steps are similar for Azure Spring Apps and Azure Container Apps.

NOTE: Azure Spring Apps currently only supports Service Connector using connection strings.

1. In the Azure portal, on the main overview page of your App Service instance, select **Service Connector** from the navigation pane.

2. Select **+ Create** from the main menu and the **Create connection** panel will open. Enter the following values:

- **Service type**: Choose **Event Hubs**.
- **Subscription**: Select the subscription you'd like to use.
- **Connection Name**: Enter a name for your connection, such as *connector_appservice_eventhub*.
- **Namespace**: Select the Event Hubs namespace you'd like to use.
- **Client type**: Leave the default value selected or choose the specific client you'd like to use.

3. Select **Next: Authentication**.
+

4. Make sure **System assigned managed identity (Recommended)** is selected, and then select **Next: Networking**.
5. Leave the default values selected, and then select **Next: Review + Create**.
6. After Azure validates your settings, select **Create**.

The Service Connector will automatically create a system-assigned managed identity for the app service. The connector will also assign the managed identity roles of *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* for the Event Hubs instance you selected.

You can create a Service Connection between an Azure compute hosting environment and a target service by using the Azure CLI. The Azure CLI automatically handles creating a managed identity and assigns the proper role, as explained in the link:#create-the-managed-identity-for-your-azure-hosting-environment[Create the managed identity for your Azure hosting environment] section.

If you're using an Azure App Service, use the `az webapp connection` command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
az webapp connection create eventhub \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name <app-service-name>
    --target-id $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID \
    --client-type kafka-springBoot \
    --system-identity
----

If you're using Azure Spring Apps, use `the az spring connection` command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
az spring connection create eventhub \
    --app <spring-app-name> \
    --service <azure-spring-service-name> \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --deployment <spring-app-deployoment-name> \
    --target-id $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID \
    --client-type kafka-springBoot \
    --system-identity
----

If you're using Azure Container Apps, use the `az containerapp connection` command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
az containerapp connection create eventhub \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name <container-app-name>
    --target-id $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID \
    --client-type kafka-springBoot \
    --system-identity
----

*App Service*

1. On the main overview page of your App Service, select **Identity** from the navigation pane.

2. Under the **System assigned** tab, make sure to set the **Status** field to **on**. A system assigned identity is managed by Azure internally and handles administrative tasks for you. The details and IDs of the identity are never exposed in your code.

4. You can assign a managed identity to an Azure Container App with the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/containerapp/identity[az containerapp identity assign] command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
export AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID=$(az containerapp identity assign \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name <container-app-name> \
    --system-assigned \
    --query principalId \
    --output tsv)
----

*Spring Apps*

1. On the main overview page of your Azure Spring App, select **Identity** from the navigation pane.

2. Under the **System assigned** tab, make sure to set the **Status** field to **on**. A system assigned identity is managed by Azure internally and handles administrative tasks for you. The details and IDs of the identity are never exposed in your code.

    --name <spring-app-name> \
    --service <spring-apps-service-name> \
    --system-assigned \
    --query identity.principalId \
    --output tsv)
----

*Virtual Machines*

1. On the main overview page of your Azure Spring App, select **Identity** from the navigation pane.

2. Under the **System assigned** tab, make sure to set the **Status** field to **on**. A system assigned identity is managed by Azure internally and handles administrative tasks for you. The details and IDs of the identity are never exposed in your code.

3. Copy the object (principal) ID.

4. You can assign a managed identity to a Virtual Machine with the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/identity[az vm identity assign] command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
export AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID=$(az vm identity assign \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name <vm-name> \
    --query principalId \
    --output tsv)
----

*AKS*

You can assign a managed identity to an Azure Kubernetes Service with the https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aks[az aks update] command, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
export AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID=$(az aks update \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name <AKS-cluster-name> \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --query identityProfile.kubeletidentity.clientId \
    --output tsv)
----

===== Assign roles to the managed identity

Next, you need to grant permissions to the managed identity you created to access your Event Hubs namespace. You can do this by assigning a role to the managed identity, just like you did with your local development user.

*Service Connector*

If you connected your services using the Service Connector, you don't need to complete this step. The following necessary configurations were handled for you:

- If you selected a managed identity while creating the connection, a system-assigned managed identity was created for your app and assigned the *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* roles on the Event Hubs.

- If you chose to use a connection string, the connection string was added as an app environment variable.

*Azure portal*

1. In the Azure portal, locate your Event Hubs namespace using the main search bar or the navigation pane.

2. On the Event Hubs overview page, select **Access control (IAM)** from the navigation menu.

3. On the **Access control (IAM)** page, select the **Role assignments** tab.

4. Select **+ Add** from the main menu and then **Add role assignment** from the drop-down menu.
+
image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58474919/192252332-c674a41e-9cc8-4eef-8e92-47ca31b42844.png[Screenshot of Azure portal Access control (IAM) page of Event Hubs Namespace resource with Add role assignment menu option highlighted]

5. Use the search box to filter the results to the desired role. For this example, search for *Azure Event Hubs Data Sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver*, select the matching result, and then select **Next**.

6. Under **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity**, and then select **+ Select members**.

7. In the flyout, search for the subscription where hosting service is located. Then, select *All system-assigned managed identities*, and select the managed identity of your hosting service. Select the system assigned identity, and then select **Select** to close the flyout menu.

8. Select **Next** a couple of times until you're able to select **Review + assign** to finish the role assignment.

*Azure CLI*

To assign a role at the resource level using the Azure CLI, you can use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
az role assignment create \
    --assignee $AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID \
    --role "Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver" \
    --scope $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID
az role assignment create \
    --assignee $AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID \
    --role "Azure Event Hubs Data Sender" \
    --scope $AZURE_EVENTHUBS_RESOURCE_ID
----

====== Test the app

After making these code changes, browse to your hosted application in the browser. Your app should be able to connect to the Azure Event Hubs for Kafka successfully. Keep in mind that it may take several minutes for the role assignments to propagate through your Azure environment. Your application is now configured to run both locally and in a production environment without the developers having to manage secrets in the application itself.
