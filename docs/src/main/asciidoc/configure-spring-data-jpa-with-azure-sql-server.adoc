==== JPA with Azure SQL Server

This article demonstrates creating a sample application that uses link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] to store and retrieve information in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/[Azure SQL Database].

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[The Java Persistence API (JPA)] is the standard Java API for object-relational mapping.

===== Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, link:https://azure.microsoft.com/free/[get a free trial].
- link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart[Azure Cloud Shell] or link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure CLI]. We recommend Azure Cloud Shell so you'll be logged in automatically and have access to all the tools you'll need.
- A supported link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure[Java Development Kit], version 8 (included in Azure Cloud Shell).
- link:https://curl.haxx.se[cURL] or a similar HTTP utility to test functionality.

===== Sample application

In this article, we will code a sample application. If you want to go faster, this application is already coded and available at link:https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quickstart-spring-data-jpa-sql-server[https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quickstart-spring-data-jpa-sql-server].

===== Prepare the working environment

First, set up some environment variables by using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP=database-workshop
AZ_DATABASE_NAME=<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>
AZ_LOCATION=<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>
AZ_SQL_SERVER_USERNAME=spring
AZ_SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD=<YOUR_AZURE_SQL_PASSWORD>
AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS=<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>
----

Replace the placeholders with the following values, which are used throughout this article:

- `<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>`: The name of your Azure SQL Database server. It should be unique across Azure.
- `<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>`: The Azure region you'll use. You can use `eastus` by default, but we recommend that you configure a region closer to where you live. You can have the full list of available regions by entering `az account list-locations`.
- `<AZ_SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD>`: The password of your Azure SQL Database server. That password should have a minimum of eight characters. The characters should be from three of the following categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0-9), and non-alphanumeric characters (!, $, #, %, and so on).
- `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>`: The IP address of your local computer, from which you'll run your Spring Boot application. One convenient way to find it is to point your browser to link:http://whatismyip.akamai.com/[whatismyip.akamai.com].

Next, create a resource group using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az group create \
    --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    | jq
----

NOTE: We use the `jq` utility to display JSON data and make it more readable. This utility is installed by default on link:https://shell.azure.com/[Azure Cloud Shell]. If you don't like that utility, you can safely remove the `| jq` part of all the commands we'll use.

===== Create an Azure SQL Database instance

The first thing we'll create is a managed Azure SQL Database server.

NOTE: You can read more detailed information about creating Azure SQL Database servers in link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?tabs=azure-portal[Quickstart: Create an Azure SQL Database single database].

In link:https://shell.azure.com/[Azure Cloud Shell], run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az sql server create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    --admin-user $AZ_SQL_SERVER_USERNAME \
    --admin-password $AZ_SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD \
    | jq
----

This command creates an Azure SQL Database server.

====== Configure a firewall rule for your Azure SQL Database server

Azure SQL Database instances are secured by default. They have a firewall that doesn't allow any incoming connection. To be able to use your database, you need to add a firewall rule that will allow the local IP address to access the database server.

Because you configured our local IP address at the beginning of this article, you can open the server's firewall by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az sql server firewall-rule create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME-database-allow-local-ip \
    --server $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --start-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --end-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    | jq
----

====== Configure a Azure SQL database

The Azure SQL Database server that you created earlier is empty. It doesn't have any database that you can use with the Spring Boot application. Create a new database called `demo` by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az sql db create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name demo \
    --server $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    | jq
----


====== Generate the application by using Spring Initializr

Generate the application on the command line by entering:

[source,bash]
----
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,sqlserver -d baseDir=azure-database-workshop -d bootVersion=2.3.1.RELEASE -d javaVersion=8 | tar -xzvf -
----

====== Configure Spring Boot to use Azure SQL Database

Open the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file, and add the following. Be sure to replace the two `$AZ_DATABASE_NAME` variables and the `$AZ_SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD` variable with the values that you configured at the beginning of this article.

[source,properties]
----
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://$AZ_DATABASE_NAME.database.windows.net:1433;database=demo;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=false;hostNameInCertificate=*.database.windows.net;loginTimeout=30;
spring.datasource.username=spring@$AZ_DATABASE_NAME
spring.datasource.password=$AZ_SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD

spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
----

WARNING: The configuration property `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` means that Spring Boot will automatically create a database schema at application start-up, and will try to delete it when it shuts down. This is great for testing, but this shouldn't be used in production!

You should now be able to start your application by using the provided Maven wrapper:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Here's a screenshot of the application running for the first time:

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-data-jpa-with-azure-sql-server/create-sql-server-01.png[The running application]

===== Code the application

Next, add the Java code that will use JPA to store and retrieve data from your Azure SQL Database.

Create a new `Todo` Java class, next to the `DemoApplication` class, and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

public class Todo {

    public Todo() {
    }

    public Todo(String description, String details, boolean done) {
        this.description = description;
        this.details = details;
        this.done = done;
    }

    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String description;

    private String details;

    private boolean done;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return details;
    }

    public void setDetails(String details) {
        this.details = details;
    }

    public boolean isDone() {
        return done;
    }

    public void setDone(boolean done) {
        this.done = done;
    }
}
----

This class is a domain model mapped on the `todo` table that you created before.

To manage that class, you'll need a repository. Define a new `TodoRepository` interface in the same package:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface TodoRepository extends CrudRepository<Todo, Long> {
}
----

This repository is a repository that Spring Data JDBC manages.

Finish the application by creating a controller that can store and retrieve data. Implement a `TodoController` class in the same package, and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/")
public class TodoController {

    private final TodoRepository todoRepository;

    public TodoController(TodoRepository todoRepository) {
        this.todoRepository = todoRepository;
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public Todo createTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
        return todoRepository.save(todo);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public Iterable<Todo> getTodos() {
        return todoRepository.findAll();
    }
}
----

Finally, halt the application and start it again using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

===== Test the application

To test the application, you can use cURL.

First, create a new "todo" item in the database using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JDBC correctly!","done": "true"}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

This command should return the created item as follows:

[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JDBC correctly!","done":true}
----

Next, retrieve the data by using a new cURL request as follows:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

This command will return the list of "todo" items, including the item you've created, as follows:

[source,json]
----
[{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up JDBC correctly!","done":true}]
----


Here's a screenshot of these cURL requests:

image:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/media/configure-spring-data-jpa-with-azure-sql-server/create-sql-server-02.png[Test with cURL]

Congratulations! You've created a Spring Boot application that uses JPA to store and retrieve data from Azure SQL Database.

===== Clean up resources

To clean up all resources used during this quickstart, delete the resource group using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
az group delete \
    --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --yes
----
