## Health Indicator

The client library comes with a Health Indicator that checks whether the connection to the Azure App Configuration store(s) is healthy or not. If enabled for each store, it gives a status of:

 * UP - The last connection was successful
* DOWN- The last connection resulted in a non 200 error code. This could be due to a number of issues ranging from credentials expiring to a service issue. The client library will automatically retry to connect to the store at the next refresh-interval.
 * NOT LOADED - The config store is listed in the local configuration file, but the config store wasn't loaded from from the file at startup. Either the config store was disabled by configuration. Otherwise, the configuration(s) loading failed to load at startup while the `fail-fast` configuration for the store was set to false.

You can enable the Health Indicator by setting `management.health.azure-app-configuration.enabled=true`.
