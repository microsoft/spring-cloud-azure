== Migration Guide for 6.0

[#migration-guide-introduction]
=== Introduction

This guide assists in the migration to *Spring Cloud Azure 6.0* from legacy Azure Spring libraries.

This guide will call libraries whose version matching `6.x` the *modern* libraries,
and those with version `4.x` the *legacy* ones.

This guide will focus the side-by-side comparisons for similar configurations between the modern and legacy libraries.

For those new to the Spring Cloud Azure 6.0 libraries, please refer to the link:index.html[Spring Cloud Azure 6.0 Reference Doc] rather than this guide.

[#migration-guide-benefits]
=== Migration Benefits

A natural question to ask when considering whether to adopt a new version or library is its benefits. As Azure has
matured and been embraced by a more diverse group of developers, we've been focused on learning the patterns and
practices to best support developer productivity and to understand the gaps that the Spring Cloud Azure libraries have.

The *Spring Cloud Azure 6.0* will benefit from the below aspects:

* Java 17 language features.
* Lots of dependencies upgrades, like Jakarta EE 9.
* Initial AOT support since Spring Framework 6.

=== Overview

This migration guide will consist following sections:

* Artifact changes: renamed / added / deleted
* Dependency changes
* Library changes

=== Artifact Changes: Renamed / Added / Deleted

In order to launch the first version to support Spring Boot 3, the Spring Cloud Azure 6.0 excluded some components that are not ready to support.

|Legacy Artifact ID |Modern Artifact ID |Description
|spring-cloud-azure-native-configuration |N/A |Deleted this artifact because the Spring Native support will use the new API based on Spring Framework 6, the adaptation work has not been completed.
|spring-cloud-azure-starter-data-cosmos |N/A |Deleted this artifact because the Spring Data 3 adaptation has not been completed.

=== Dependency Changes

The modern Spring Cloud Azure 6.0 libraries are based on Jakarta EE 9, which uses a new top-level jakarta package, it's required to replace EE 8â€™s javax top-level package.
Please make sure to correct the `javax` package to `jakarta` package in your application.

Libraries that have dependency changes include:

- <<dependency-spring-cloud-azure-starter-active-directory, spring-cloud-azure-starter-active-directory>>
- <<dependency-spring-cloud-azure-starter-active-directory-b2c, spring-cloud-azure-starter-active-directory-b2c>>
- <<dependency-spring-cloud-azure-starter-servicebus-jms, spring-cloud-azure-starter-servicebus-jms>>

=== Library Changes

Breaking changes in each library are introduced as follows.
