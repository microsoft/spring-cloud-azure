== Key Values

Azure App Configuration Supports multiple types of key values, some of which have special features built into them. Azure App Configuration has built in support for JSON content type, Spring placeholders, an Key Value references.

=== Placeholders

The client library supports configurations with `${}`-style environment placeholders. If referencing a Azure App Configuration key with a placeholder any prefix needs to be removed in the reference. For example: `/application/config.message` is referenced as `${config.message}`.

NOTE: The prefix being removed matches the value `spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].selects[0].key-filter`.

=== JSON

Configurations that have the a content-type `application/json` are processed as json objects. This enables one configuration mapping to a complex object in a `@Configuration`. The json key `/application/config.colors` with the value

	},
	"Green": {
		"value": [0, 0, 255]
	}
}

maps to

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "config")
public class MyConfigurations {

    private HashMap<String, Color> colors;

}

=== Key Vault References

Azure App Configuration and its client libraries support referencing secrets stored in Key Vault. In App Configuration, keys can be created which have values that map to a  secret stored in a Key Vault. The secrets are securely stored in Key Vault, but can be accessed the same as any other configuration once loaded.

Your application uses the client provider to retrieve Key Vault references, just as it does for any other keys stored in App Configuration. Because the client recognizes the keys as Key Vault references, they have a unique content-type, and the client will connect to Key Vault to retrieve their values for you.

NOTE: Key Vault only allows for secrets to be retrieved one at a time, so each Key Vault reference stored in App Configuration will result in a pull against Key Vault.

==== Creating Key Vault References

You can easily create a Key Vault reference in the Azure Portal in the Configuration explorer using the Create -> Key Vault reference option. You will be able to select a secret to reference, this can be from any of the Key Vaults you have access to. You can also create arbitrary Key Vault references using the Input option. Through the portal a valid URI Key Vault is required and using a Key Vault reference format.

You can also create a Key Vault reference through the cli using:

[source,azurecli,indent=0]
----
az appconfig kv set-keyvault --name <name-of-your-store> --key <key-name> --secret-identifier <uri-to-your-secret>
----

Though the CLI any secret-identifier with the format of `{vault}/{collection}/{name}/{version?}` where the version section is optional.

==== Using Key Vault References

If you are using a User Assigned or System Assigned Identity all you need to do is make sure that identity also has access to the Key Vault and reading secrets.

Otherwise, you need to provide a Token Credential for the client library to use to connect to your Key Vault with.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MyCredentials implements KeyVaultCredentialProvider {

    @Override
    public TokenCredential getKeyVaultCredential(String uri) {
            return buildCredential();
    }

    TokenCredential buildCredential() {
            return new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build();
    }

}
----

Using the KeyVaultCredentialProvider you can provide any TokenCredential type supported by the link:https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#credential-classes[Azure Identity Library].

==== Resolve Non Key Vault Secrets

The App Configuration client provides a method of locally resolving secrets that don't have a Key Vault associated with them. This is done through the `KeyVaultSecretProvider`. The `KeyVaultSecretProvider` is called when a `TokenCredential` isn't provided for a Key Vault reference, the uri of the Key Vault reference is provided and return value becomes the value of the secret.

WARNING: Creating a `KeyVaultSecretProvider` overrides the automatic use of System Assigned Identity. In order to use both, `KeyVaultCredentialProvider` needs to be used and return `null` for URI's that need to resolve using `KeyVaultSecretProvider`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MySecretProvider implements KeyVaultSecretProvider {

    @Override
    public String getSecret(String uri) {
        ...
    }
