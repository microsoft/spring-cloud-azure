=== Basic Usage

Spring Cloud Azure Resource Manager can work together with specific Spring Cloud Azure starters to retrieve connection information, such as connection strings, to connect to Azure services. It can also work together with `spring-cloud-azure-starter` and third-party libraries to retrieve metadata like username/password, and to complete authentication, For more information, see the <<Kafka Support>> and <<Redis Support>> sections.

For example, to retrieve the connection string of an Azure Service, developers can use a service principal as the credential to authenticate and retrieve the connection string. The configuration is listed the follows. The provided service principal should
be assigned a role of `Contributor` of the associated namespace at least. See link:index.html#authorize-access-with-azure-active-directory[Authorize access with Azure AD] to make sure the principal has been granted the sufficient permission to access the Azure resource.
